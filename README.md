## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Prakruti, and I'm interested in engineering and neuroscience. I'm passionate about leveraging machine learning techniques to advance these fields. To achieve this, I'm focused on deepening my understanding of computer science, particularly in areas like algorithms, data structures, and neural networks, to develop innovative solutions at the intersection of these disciplines.

Some Projects That I've been working on: ðŸ’« 

- [Quote Repository](https://jplip.github.io/self-care-front/quoterepo) : I've developed a quote repository system designed to assist users in storing and managing inspirational quotes. Users can input and save quotes along with the author's name, their personal opinion, and a rating out of five stars. The repository allows users to view their stored quotes and sort them using a selection sort algorithm, facilitating an organized retrieval. Additionally, users can search quotes based on their rating, filtering by 5 stars, 4 stars, and so on. This system is particularly beneficial for individuals with mental health challenges, providing a personalized collection of motivational quotes for reflection and inspiration.

- [Heart Attack Prediction](https://jplip.github.io/self-care-front/heartattack)) : I've developed a heart attack predictor using a dataset from Kaggle. This model leverages decision tree algorithms to analyze various health indicators and predict the likelihood of a heart attack. By training on a comprehensive dataset that includes factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits, the model can accurately assess an individual's risk. The decision tree model excels in handling both numerical and categorical data, making it an ideal choice for this predictive task. Inputs are processed to generate a probabilistic output, indicating the chance of a heart attack, which can be crucial for early intervention and personalized healthcare planning.
